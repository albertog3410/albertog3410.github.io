            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project Website</h1>
 <p> This year long project is all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.For my project, I chose the topic of <strong>Graphic Design.</strong> To make my project, I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/start/installation/">Bulma.io</a> in order to help me make my website.</p>
 <p> Along the way there were many challenges that I learned from. One of them having to do with the process of learning the tool I chose to help me make my freedom project website. When first starting to learn how to use Bulma.io, there were soo many components that it felt like too much to learn. However, throughout the weeks that I had to learn my tool, I took multiple notes in my learning log, so that I can remember what components I used and how to use those components. When tinkering with Bulma's components I had used the components that I have written in my learning log to make my own prototype website so that I can be ready for when I start to make my Freedom Project Website. Even though I never got the chance to finish this prototype website, it reallyed helped in showing me the many possible ways that I can use Bulma.io in my website. From this, I have learned to be patient as I learn new material on my own.</p>

            <p> Another challenge during this project was presenting it towards a large group of people. After I was done with my website, I had to present the steps I took to create the project to the class and to other students in a tech expo. In my presentation, I had to talk about <strong>what my website was about, how I made my website, overview about the topic I researched, how I got my information and what I learned from this project.</strong> I am usually a shy person when it comes to presenting in front of a large group, so I got nervous when I heard that I had to present my project in front of a large group. At first, I did not know what I could say when it was my turn to go up to the class. But as I got my thoughts together, I minimized my ideas so that I can present them clearly through images on my google slides. From this experience, I learned how to<strong> effectively break down tasks and develop my communication skills</strong> in not just the project, but also an internship that I have attended throughout the course of making my freedom project.</p>

            <p> This year long project has presented many challenges to me, but also helped me grow in developing my communication skills with others, which has encouraged me to speak more outside of the SEP10 class. Overall, despite this year long project being hard to complete, I enjoyed exploring a career about something that I do not know much about and using it to create my Freedom Project Website!</p>
