            <h1 class="margin text-center"> CYOA Project</h1>
            <p> In this project me and my partner had to use what we learned about navigating Github and our IDE to create an interactive CYOA(classic text-based adventure). Our project was named <strong>Escaping Reality</strong?></strong></p>
            
            <p>In this CYOA, the main character discovers a hole in his gardin that if he decides to enter, leads him into a different reality. The decisions will decide if he dies a death no human has experienced before or escape to tell the tale. </p>
            
            <p>Over the course of our work, one of the most difficult part of finishing it all was solving git conflicts, which is when one of us is making different changes on the same line of an html page. When this occurs, the computer gets confused as to which changes do we really want on the page. It took a long while to resolve this conflict, and being that my partner couldn't be in class on some days which made it harder to collaberate. However, as we worked together through slack, I realized that there was nothing to worry about and that we were going to finish the project.   </p>
            
            <p>My biggest takeaways throughout this project was learning how to be patient with my partner and getting more of an understanding of how to navigate my IDE. Before this project, there were some things about using my IDE that I still had questions, and working with someone else has helped me answer those questions. The next steps that I want to take going forward is to try to practice using my IDE whenever I get the chance to so that I can add more to my notes. </p>
